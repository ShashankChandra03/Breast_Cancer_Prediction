# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
This project uses the scikit-learn breast cancer dataset to develop machine learning models for cancer detection. Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression were implemented, achieving accuracies of 97% and 96%, respectively. The project highlights the potential of machine learning in reliable and efficient cancer diagnostics.
