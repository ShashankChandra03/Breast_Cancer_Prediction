# **Breast Cancer Prediction**

Welcome to the **Breast Cancer Prediction** project! üéóÔ∏è This project leverages machine learning to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign using the scikit-learn breast cancer dataset. The aim is to assist in early detection, providing a reliable and efficient solution for healthcare diagnostics.

## **Overview**

The project demonstrates the use of machine learning models for breast cancer prediction. Two models, **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**, were implemented and evaluated. The models achieved impressive accuracies of 97% and 96%, respectively, highlighting the power of AI in supporting critical healthcare decisions.

## **Features**
- **Multiple Models**: Implements and compares Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves up to 97% accuracy in predictions.
- **Visual Comparisons**: Graphical analysis of model performance for better understanding.
- **Reproducible Code**: Clear, modular, and beginner-friendly implementation.

## **Use Cases**
- **Early Cancer Detection**: Helps in identifying malignant and benign cases efficiently.
- **Healthcare Assistance**: Supports medical professionals with quick and reliable predictions.
- **Machine Learning Education**: Acts as a practical guide for beginners in supervised learning.

## **How It Works**
1. **Dataset Loading**: Uses the scikit-learn breast cancer dataset, which is preprocessed and ready for modeling.
2. **Data Splitting**: Divides the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
3. **Model Training**: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models are trained on the dataset.
4. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Models predict cancer classes, and their accuracy is calculated and compared.
5. **Visualization**: A bar chart graphically displays the accuracy of both models.
